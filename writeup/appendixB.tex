% \noindent\paragraph{(Data, Stardate 1403827)}
% (A one-page chapter --- page must be numbered!)
% Throughout the ages, from Keats to Giorchamo, poets have
% composed ``odes'' to individuals who have had a profound effect
% upon their lives.  In keeping with that tradition
% I have written my next poem \ldots in honor of my cat.
% I call it\ldots{}Ode\ldots{}to Spot.
% (Shot of Geordi and Worf in audience,
% looking mystified at each other.)


% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent Felus cattus, is your taxonomic nomenclature \\
% an endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature? \\
% Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses \\
% contribute to your hunting skills, and natural defenses. \\
% I find myself intrigued by your sub-vocal oscillations, \\
% a singular development of cat communications \\
% that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection \\
% for a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection. \\
% A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents; \\
% you would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance. \\
% And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion, \\
% It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.
% \end{quotation}


% \noindent(Commander Riker begins to applaud, until a
% glance from Counselor Troi brings him to a halt.)
% Commander Riker, you have anticipated my denouement.
% However, the sentiment is appreciated.  I will continue.


% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent O Spot, the complex levels of behavior you display \\
% connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array. \\
% And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend \\
% I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend.
% \end{quotation}
